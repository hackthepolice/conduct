# Hack the Police 4

[Hack the Police](https://hackthepolice.com) is a hackathon event organised by [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org), a group for volunteer professionals. We are primarily interested in civic technology - created to help people solve problems and interact with the world around them.

This year, the event takes place at the Computacenter offices in London, Blackfriars, over the weekend of 14-15 September 2019.

Participants will be hacking in the _hackathon_ sense - building new tools and prototypes to solve problems in public safety and crime. They will not be _hacking into_ anything, nor do we condone the access of machines or data without the permission of their owners.

## Code of Conduct

All our events should be accessible, safe, friendly and fun.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md) to understand the standards of behaviour that we expect from our participants.

If at any time you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please let one of the organisers know and we will intervene.

## Safeguarding Policy

Please note that we cannot accommodate participants under the age of 14.

It is very important that we are able to contact you to check on your wellbeing, and that we have made contact with a parent/guardian to ensure that they also understand the nature of our event, our policies, and can reach them should we need to.

**If you are under 18,** please read our [Safeguarding Policy](Safeguarding.md) and then fill out the [Hack the Police 4 Safeguarding form](https://forms.gle/JWf7kzPb3yAkdnKG8).

**If you are the parent of a youth attending our event,** please read our [Safeguarding Policy](Safeguarding.md) and then fill out the [Hack the Police 4 parent/guardian contact form]().
