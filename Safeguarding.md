# Safeguarding at Hack the Police

[Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org) is committed to protecting the health, well-being and human rights of any and all participants at [Hack the Police](https://hackthepolice.com). This policy outlines the measures that we employ to ensure:

* that nobody is subjected to abuse, harm or neglect;
* that everybody is able to experience the festival within a safe and supportive environment.

## Applicability and scope

The measures stated in this policy are the responsibility of the Hack the Police team.

We have a duty of care to implement this policy and, where this falls outside of our remit, to ensure that the appropriate responsible person takes responsibility.

## Measures prior to the event

Our event brings police officers together with technology professionals and students. In order to ensure that there is sufficient adult supervision, and that those adults are appropriately suited to the responsibility of working with young people, we inform and alert our police officer participants to the safeguarding issues present - including the number of youths we expect at the event.

## Permission from a parent of guardian

Any youth (aged under 18, but no younger than 14) wishing to take part in the hackathon must have their attendance explicitly supported by a parent or guardian, and that parent or guardian will be involved in pertinent correspondence to ensure that we have enough information to assure that the youth has arrived safely.

We will collect contact information for the parent/guardian prior to the event through the [Hack the Police Safeguarding form](https://forms.gle/JWf7kzPb3yAkdnKG8).

## Measures during the hackathon weekend

Our venue is an enclosed space, with access control for authorised people only. We will coordinate with building security to ensure that we do not accept uninvited people into the space during the event.

Access points for entry/exit will be monitored by building security staff.

Young persons with approved tickets of 16 years or older may arrive and depart from the event unaccompanied.

Young persons with approved tickets under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent/guardian when being dropped off and collected from the venue.

If a young person under 16 arrives at their event unaccompanied, or without having completed their safeguarding information, they will be permitted to participate in the event (as we consider it safer than sending them away) but cannot be released at the end of the day unless collected by a parent/guardian. We will contact the parent/guardian to ensure this is followed through.

## Code of conduct

Any and all participants, volunteers, organisers, speakers, and sponsors must agree and abide by our [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md).

In the event of a Code of Conduct violation by any parties, reports can be made via email, Twitter direct message, telephone or anonymously online. Reports will be restricted to core Hack the Police team members for investigation.

## Sleeping spaces

The event allows for our adult participants to stay at the venue overnight, and we provide a sleeping space for that purpose.

*This is not available to participants under the age of 18,* and the cut-off time for those participants to leave the venue is 9pm.

## Access to quiet spaces

Any participants affected by hypersensory conditions will be able to access a quiet area so that they may more comfortably manage their experience of the event.

## Changes to policy

This policy might change over time, which we reserve the right to do without notice. If we do make edits, you'll find them listed below.
